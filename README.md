# Ellipsoids

Look at the Demo project to see how to render a unit sphere.

If the image starts flickering/glitching, increase the number of rasterizers, or the number of quadrics per rasterizer.
There is a function to do this in the QuadricRenderer class.

I am aware the Directx12 implementation is bad.
