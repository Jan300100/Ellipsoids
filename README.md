# Ellipsoids

Look at the Demo project to see how to render a unit sphere.

If the image starts flickering/glitching, increase the number of rasterizers, or the number of quadrics per rasterizer.
There is a function to do this in the QuadricRenderer class.

make sure the shaders the renderer uses  can be found in the working directory.
This is the 'Shaders' folder you can find in the renderer.

I am aware the Directx12 implementation is bad.
