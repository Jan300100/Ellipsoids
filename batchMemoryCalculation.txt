Memory in gpu memory:

instanceBuffers; // position of every instance for each mesh.
meshBuffers; // inQ for each mesh.

Memory per batch "drawCall":

1. [x,y,z,w] * batchSize //inputQ 'indices'
	x = inQ idx; //which quadric in the 'meshBuffer'?
	y = instance idx; // which instance in instanceBuffer?
	z = instanceBuffer idx // which instanceBuffer?
	w = inQBuffer idx // which 'meshBuffer'?
 
2. batchSize * sizeof(outputQ); //outputQ's

3. batchSize * (screenW / tileW) * (screenH / tileH); // tileMemory, each tile has enough memory to store [batchsize] indices.
